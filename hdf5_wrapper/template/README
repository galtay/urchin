HDF5 Wrapper library for Fortran 90
-----------------------------------

This assumes that you already have HDF5 installed, and that you know where
it is. You'll probably need to compile HDF5, the HDF5 wrapper and any
programs that use the wrapper using the same Fortran 90 compiler.


1. Introduction:
----------------

This library is intended to provide a simple way to read and write HDF5
data files. It can:

* Create HDF5 files or open existing files

* Read and write 0-7 dimensional HDF5 datasets and/or attributes of the
  following Fortran types:

  - REAL
  - DOUBLE PRECISION
  - INTEGER*4
  - INTEGER*8
  - CHARACTER

* Create HDF5 groups and read/write attributes or datasets stored in groups

* Use gzip compression for large datasets

There is currently no support for user defined datatypes.


2. Compilation:
---------------

Go to the ./src subdirectory and copy the config.* file corresponding to
your system to 'config' - e.g. if you have the Portland f90 compiler do

cd src
cp config.Portland config

Edit the line that starts

HDF5 = ...

to show the path where HDF5 is installed. This directory should contain the
HDF5 lib/ and include/ subdirectories.

The config file specifies the name of the Fortran and C compilers and the 
flags needed to compile the HDF5 wrapper and link with HDF5. If none of the
existing config files are appropriate you'll need to copy one of them and
modify it as necessary.

The existing configuration files are:

config.Portland  - to use the Portland(pgf90) and gcc compilers on Linux
config.NAGWare   - to use the NAGWare(f90) and gcc compilers on Linux
config.Solaris32 - to compile 32 bit code on Solaris (using Sun f90 and cc)
config.Solaris64 - to compile 64 bit code on Solaris (using Sun f90 and cc)
config.Intel     - to compile using the Intel(ifort) and gcc compilers on linux

Next, type 'make' in the src directory and the wrapper library will be
compiled. This will create a lib directory containing the file
'libhdfwrapper.so'.


3. Example programs:
--------------------

There are two small example programs in the 'test' subdirectory.
'test_write.exe' writes an HDF5 file and 'test_read.exe' reads it back in.

When the wrapper library is compiled a Makefile for these programs is also
created (as ./test/Makefile) so you should be able to compile the programs
just by typing 'make' in the ./test subdirectory.

The simplest way to link the HDF5 wrapper into your own programs is to
copy or modify this Makefile.


4. Using the HDF5 Wrapper library:
----------------------------------

To use the wrapper you need to link in the HDF5 and wrapper libraries
when you compile your program. See the Makefile in the test/ directory
for an example of how to do this. In your Fortran 90 source file you'll
need to 'USE' the hdf5_wrapper module:

USE hdf5_wrapper

The HDF5 wrapper provides the following routines. Optional parameters
are shown in square brackets.

Parameters shown as 'any allowed type' - e.g.

 (any allowed type) :: data

may be scalars or 1-7 dimensional arrays of REAL, DOUBLE PRECISION, INTEGER*4,
INTEGER*8 or CHARACTER.

HDF5 differentiates between strings and arrays of characters:

CHARACTER :: str(10)

would be written as a ten element array of single characters, whereas

CHARACTER(LEN=10) :: str

or

CHARACTER*10 : str

would be written as a string of length 10. 

CHARACTER(LEN=10) :: str(3,5)

would be a 3x5 element array of strings, each with length 10.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBROUTINE hdf5_open_file(ifile, filename, [readonly])  

INTEGER :: ifile
CHARACTER(LEN=*) :: filename
LOGICAL :: readonly

This opens an existing file. The name of the file to open is given by the
'filename' parameter. An integer file handle is returned in 'ifile'. This
file handle is used to identify the file in any subsequent read, write or
close operations - its similar to the unit number in normal Fortran IO
statements. If the parameter 'readonly' is set to .TRUE. any attempt to
write to the file will cause an error.
If the file does not exist an error occurs and the program aborts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBROUTINE hdf5_create_file(ifile, fname)

INTEGER :: ifile
CHARACTER(LEN=*) :: filename

This creates a new HDF5 file. The name of the file is given by the 
'filename' parameter and an integer file handle is returned in 'ifile'. Any
existing file with the same name is overwritten.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBROUTINE hdf5_get_dimensions(ifile, name, rank, dims)

INTEGER :: ifile
CHARACTER(LEN=*) :: name
INTEGER :: rank
INTEGER, DIMENSION(*) :: dims

Return the size of an HDF5 dataset in the file with integer handle 'ifile'.
The name of the dataset is specified by the 'name' parameter. The number of
dimensions of the dataset is returned in 'rank' and the number of elements
in each dimension is returned in dims(1:rank).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBROUTINE hdf5_read_data(ifile, name, data[, start, count])

INTEGER :: ifile
CHARACTER(LEN=*) :: name
(any allowed type) :: data
INTEGER, DIMENSION(:) :: start, count

Read an HDF5 dataset with pathname 'name' from the file with handle 'ifile'.
The contents of the dataset are returned in the variable 'data', which must
have the same rank as the dataset. If the dataset is an array, 'data' must
be an array which is at least as large as the dataset in every dimension. If
the dataset doesn't exist an error occurs.

The start and count parameters allow reading of parts of a dataset and must
be dimensioned to at least the rank of the dataset in the file. start(i)
specifies the first element to read in the i'th dimension and count(i)
specifies how many elements to read in the i'th dimension. start and count
must always be declared as arrays (not scalars), even when reading a 1D
dataset.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUBROUTINE hdf5_write_data(ifile, name, data[, gzip] [, initial_size]
                           [, start, count] [, overwrite] [, extensible])

INTEGER :: ifile
CHARACTER(LEN=*) :: name
(any allowed type) :: data
INTEGER :: gzip
INTEGER, DIMENSION(:) :: start, count, initial_size
LOGICAL :: overwrite, extensible

Write the contents of 'data' to a HDF5 dataset with pathname 'name' in the
file with handle 'ifile'. If the path contains the names of groups which
do not exist, these groups are created. If the dataset does not exist
it will be created. If overwrite=.true., any existing dataset at this
location is deleted and a new one is created.

The start and count parameters specify which part of the dataset the
data should be written to and have the same meaning as in hdf5_read_data().
If the elements specified by start and count lie outside the dataset
and the dataset was created with extensible=.true., the dataset will be
extended.

initial_size allows you to specify the size of the dataset in each
dimension when it is created. This means you can create a dataset which is
larger than the array you're writing out and then fill in the rest of the
elements later using the start and count parameters.

If the gzip parameter is present the data will be compressed. The value
of gzip is the compression level, as used in the Unix gzip command.
Scalar data cannot be compressed. Adding 10 to the gzip value activates
HDF5's 'shuffle' filter which can improve compression on datasets with
lots of similar values.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBROUTINE hdf5_write_attribute(ifile, name, data [, overwrite])

INTEGER :: ifile
CHARACTER(LEN=*) :: name
(any allowed type) :: data
LOGICAL :: overwrite

Write the contents of 'data' to a HDF5 attribute with pathname 'name' in the
file with handle 'ifile'. Attributes must be attached to a group or a dataset.
If the parent object in the pathname is not a group or a dataset, or doesn't
exist, an error occurs.

If overwrite=.true. and the attribute already exists, it will be deleted
and recreated with the new value.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBROUTINE hdf5_read_attribute(ifile, name, data)

INTEGER :: ifile
CHARACTER(LEN=*) :: name
(any allowed type) :: data

Read the attribute given by the pathname 'name' and return the contents of
the attribute in 'data'. The variable 'data' must have the same rank as the
attribute and must be at least as large as the attribute in every dimension.
If the attribute doesn't exist an error occurs.

BUG: For multidimensional attributes the data array must be EXACTLY the same
size as the attribute being read in all dimensions otherwise the elements
get scrambled.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBROUTINE hdf5_create_group(ifile, name)

INTEGER :: ifile
CHARACTER(LEN=*) :: name

Create a new HDF5 group in the file with handle 'ifile'. The pathname of the
new group is specified by the 'name' parameter. If the pathname contains
parent groups which do not exist these groups will be created.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBROUTINE hdf5_close_file(ifile)

INTEGER :: ifile

Closes the file specified by the file handle 'ifile'.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBROUTINE hdf5_get_dimensions(ifile,name,rank,dims)

INTEGER :: ifile
CHARACTER(len=*) :: name
INTEGER :: rank
INTEGER, DIMENSION(:) :: dims

This returns the rank and dimensions of the specified dataset or
attribute.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBROUTINE hdf5_get_type(ifile,name,datatype,size)

INTEGER :: ifile
CHARACTER(len=*) :: name
CHARACTER(len=*) :: datatype
INTEGER :: size

Returns information about the type of data in a dataset. The string
parameter 'datatype' will return "REAL", "INTEGER", "STRING", or "OTHER".
"OTHER" indicates that the dataset contains a datatype which cannot be
read using the wrapper (e.g. a compound data type.)

The integer 'size' gives the number of bytes used to store one element in the
dataset. For example, a dataset containing Fortran default reals will
usually return datatype="REAL" and size=4. Double precision data will
return datatype="REAL" and size=8. For string data, size gives the 
length of the string(s).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

INTEGER(kind=hid_t) FUNCTION hdf5_get_file_id(ifile)

INTEGER :: ifile

Given an integer file handle, this returns the corresponding HDF5 file
identifier. This can be used for direct calls to HDF5 in cases where
facilities not provided by the wrapper are required.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUBROUTINE hdf5_list_datasets  (ifile, name, ndatasets, dataset_names)
SUBROUTINE hdf5_list_groups    (ifile, name, ngroups,   group_names  )
SUBROUTINE hdf5_list_attributes(ifile, name, nattribs,  attrib_names)

INTEGER :: ifile
CHARACTER(len=*) :: name
INTEGER                        :: ndatasets, ngroups, nattrib
CHARACTER(len=*), DIMENSION(:) :: dataset_names, group_names, attrib_names

These routines return the number of datasets/groups/attributes at the
specified location and an array of strings containing their names.
For hdf5_list_datasets and hdf5_list_groups, 'name' must be the location
of a group. For hdf5_list_attributes, 'name' must be the location of a
group or a dataset.
